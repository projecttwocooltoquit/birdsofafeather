# Description

This browser application allows a user to discover birds in their area via the power of google maps! Users can input (using drop down menus) their location and view the map displayed on the right to find the beautiful birds they can spot in their area. Should the user chose to create a profile, they can save keep track of the birds they have viewed and note birds that they wish to view. 

Upon accessing the web application, the user is taken to the homescreen. If they are a first time user, they can chose to sign up by clicking on the corresponding Log In button on the nav bar. (Include more as we continue ironing this out)
